          <p> I am currently an uplifted budtender looking to make some awesome websites. I'm a seeker looking to seek understanding within developing visually awesome websites! I've had a handful of various professions within my lifetime including Plumbing to Retail Grocery work. Iâ€™m excited to bring my perception of life to the expression of building fantastic-looking websites.</p>
          <p>I am a life-long learner who's always interested in self-mastery.  Self-mastery is one of my favorite things to do.</p>

          <p> Self-determination is key to victory in life.  No matter how many times life pulls you down, if you get back up it becomes better and things become easier.  Believe in yourself and anything can be possible!</p>
